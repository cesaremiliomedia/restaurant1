  info4: `Sample Data: we think life is a taco
  Because when you take the highest quality-items from authentic sources and roll them up into one, you get satisfaction. That’s our story, and one of the most important ingredients was you, our community. We built our company with your support, and in thanks we want to do more than feed you.`,
  info3: `Sample Data: we’re serious about one thing. And one thing only. Our food. We source the highest quality ingredients around so we can serve up the best damn taco (or salad) you’ve ever tasted. Cooked to order—just the way you like it.`,
  info6: `This simple one page website can help you tell the story of your restaurant/food truck. Customers will get a good idea of who you are, as well as get an idea of the overall atmosphere of your business. Your website is the perfect platform to update guests about new menu items, specials, address, hours of operation, events, seasonal hours, etc.`,
  info2: `In the early 20th century, Dora “Abuelita” raised a family of seven children to love food and communal meals. An inspired cook, Dora prepared massive spreads for not only her children, but the whole neighborhood. Laborers came to eat at her table, where she habitually laid out an elaborate salsa bar for her guests and patrons.

    With its continued popularity, the children began to dream big, and went into business as a family with the opening of “Las Nubes” restaurant in the 1960s. Together, they developed a culture of diligence and cooperation that sustains the company to this day.
    
    In our salsa bar you’ll find everything you need to build up your perfect taco; six different types of salsas, made daily from scratch, ranging from the all time favorite guacamole to the spiciest “salsa roja”, as well as many fresh vegetables to choose from: lettuce, radishes, onions, cilantro, chiles toreados, pickled onions, cucumbers and limes.`,
